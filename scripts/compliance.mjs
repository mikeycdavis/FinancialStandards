/**
 * The compliance engine: catalog + policy + observed findings → a verdict.
 *
 *   observed finding + applicability + exceptions + attestation + assurance
 *       → COMPLIANT | COMPLIANT_WITH_EXCEPTIONS | NON_COMPLIANT | NOT_EVALUATED
 *         | BLOCKED_BY_INVARIANT
 *
 * Four properties of this module are load-bearing. The first three are inherited and must survive
 * every change (ADR 0001); the fourth is this repository's own (ADR 0006).
 *
 *   1. Status is computed from rules, never from the score. There is no threshold at which a
 *      percentage grants or withdraws compliance.
 *   2. A rule nothing evaluated is `skipped`, never `passed`. Unknown is not a pass. A false red has
 *      a complainant; a false green has none, by construction.
 *   3. The score's denominator is the rules that were actually evaluated, and the assurance
 *      breakdown ships beside it so the number cannot imply coverage it does not have.
 *   4. A failed non-exemptible rule is BLOCKED_BY_INVARIANT, not NON_COMPLIANT, and it outranks
 *      every other verdict. The distinction is the point: "this analysis does not yet satisfy a
 *      requirement" and "you are asking for something that would violate the integrity of the
 *      standards system" call for different responses, and collapsing them invites the second to be
 *      treated like the first — as something to fix by editing the rule.
